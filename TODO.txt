The purpose of this file is to semi-track the changes I want to make and what
I have done to actually implement the changes. This is one of many side projects
so the interval dates will likely be very large and the resolutions minimal.

  New / Unresolved:
    *add react router to the application
      -router seems to be installed, but not doing anything useful yet
    *add redux to the application
    *add devise for authentication
    *add automated confirmation email
    *lock down API so not just anyone can create things
      -directly dependent on having devise in the application

  Resolved:
  	*figure out how to copy servers quickly / document how to make aws server
      - readme has most of the information on how to do this
  	*add a real deployment method (current is ok , not great)
      - passenger is now good to go on the staging (only) environment!
