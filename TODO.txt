The purpose of this file is to semi-track the changes I want to make and what
I have done to actually implement the changes. This is one of many side projects
so the interval dates will likely be very large and the resolutions minimal.

  New / Unresolved:
    Highest priority to lowest:

    Infrastructure
    --------------
    *add redux to the application
    *add devise for authentication
      *verify routes work for action mailer on stage.
        Reference this file: /Users/Admin/PracticeApp/config/environments/production.rb
        and this line: config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'bagofmanythings.com', port: 25 }
      *add automated confirmation email
    *add react router to the application
      -router seems to be installed, but not doing anything useful yet
    *consider different options for adding style to the site
      -options would include things like Material.Ui or maybe some more advance CSS with boostrap?

    Below here are all same priority for now

    Basic Character Creation
    ------------------------
    Character Creation Form
    *install some tool for easy validation 
    *modify model for Character with new attributes

    Generate Character PDF
    *get pdf template of dnd 5e
    *install prawnpdf gem from: https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn
    *not considering items and inventory at this point in time

    Level Up Character Tool
    *Create some sort of workflow that can be easily used for all the classes
      - each step of the way present options on what choices there are and offer
        alerts for new abilities and changes to character sheet
        - maybe show character sheet with highlighting around changes?
    *To start DO NOT allow multiclassing (that'll get complicated)

  Resolved:
    *figure out how to copy servers quickly / document how to make aws server
      - readme has most of the information on how to do this
    *add a real deployment method (current is ok , not great)
      - passenger is now good to go on the staging (only) environment!
